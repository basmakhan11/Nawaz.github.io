    <h2>Research Assistant</h2>
    <p><strong>Organization:</strong> Medical Imaging and Diagnostic Laboratory, National Centre of Artificial Intelligence (MIDL-NCAI)</p>
    <p><strong>Dates:</strong> 01/03/2021 â€“ 25/04/2023</p>
    <p><strong>Location:</strong> Islamabad, Pakistan</p>
    <p><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://midl.comsats.edu.pk/about-us.html">https://midl.comsats.edu.pk/about-us.html</a></p>
    <p><strong>Department:</strong> Research and Development</p>
    <p><strong>Sector:</strong> Professional, scientific, and technical activities</p>
    <p>During my tenure at COMSATS University Islamabad's MIDL-NCAI Lab, I held various roles, including Research Assistant, Research Scholar, and MS Student. Within the Tuberculosis group, our primary objective was to develop and train cutting-edge Deep Learning models using Chest X-Ray radiographs. Our aim was to create an automated system capable of identifying different lung diseases. Throughout my work, I extensively worked with radiograph datasets such as CheXpert, TBX11K, and COVID-19.</p>
    <p>My responsibilities encompassed not only disease detection and categorization but also the development of an Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) system. This system aimed to make the algorithm understandable to users, particularly medical professionals. One of our notable achievements was the publication of an article that significantly contributed to the fields of weakly supervised learning, XAI, and data augmentation. In this article, we described how an algorithm could be trained on image-level labels to visualize the effects of diseases and generate pixel-level labels.</p>
    <p>Overall, my experience at the MIDL-NCAI Lab involved the utilization of innovative Deep Learning techniques for the analysis of Chest X-Ray radiographs, focusing on disease identification and the development of an XAI system.</p>
